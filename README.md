Credit Card Fraud Detection using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML using python as the programming language using real dataset to train each of these models. 

Today, I want to share with you a project I recently completed involving credit card fraud detection using the Python programming language and two powerful machine learning libraries: Scikit-Learn and Snap ML.

Snap ML is a high-performance IBM library for ML modeling. It provides highly-efficient CPU/GPU implementations of linear models and tree-based models. Snap ML not only accelerates ML algorithms through system awareness, but also offers novel ML algorithms with best-in-class accuracy

I used the Scikit-Learn and Snap ML libraries in Python to train and evaluate two Support Vector Machine models using a real dataset of credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The goal was to predict whether a transaction was legitimate or not based on various features such as transaction amount, location, and type of purchase.

To train the models, I first split the dataset into a training and testing set and used the training set to fit the models. I then used the testing set to evaluate the performance of each model and calculated the ROC-AUC score, which is a measure of the model's ability to correctly classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

After analyzing the results, I found that both the Scikit-Learn and Snap ML models performed well, with the Snap ML model slightly outperforming the Scikit-Learn model. However, both models showed strong potential for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy.

Overall, this project highlighted the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. I look forward to continuing to explore new ways to leverage the power of data and machine learning to solve complex problems and make a positive impact in the world.
